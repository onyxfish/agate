1.2.0
-----

This version introduces one breaking change, which is only relevant if you are using custom :class:`.Computation` subclasses.

1. :class:`.Computation` has been modified so that :meth:`.Computation.run` takes a :class:`.Table` instance as its argument, rather than a single row. It must return a sequence of values to use for a new column. In addition, the :meth:`.Computation._prepare` method has been renamed to :meth:`.Computation.validate` to more accurately describe it's function. These changes were made to facilitate computing moving averages, streaks and other values that require data for the full column.

* Existing :class:`.Aggregation` subclasses have been updated to use :meth:`.Aggregate.validate`. (This brings a noticeable performance boost.)
* :class:`.Aggregation` now has a :meth:`.Aggregation.validate` method that functions identically to :meth:`.Computation.validate`. (#421)
* :meth:`.Change.validate` now correctly raises :class:`.DataTypeError`.
* Added a ``SimpleMovingAverage`` implementation to the cookbook's examples of custom :class:`.Computation` classes.
* :meth:`.Computation._prepare` has been renamed to :meth:`.Computation.validate`.
* :meth:`.Computation.run` now takes a :class:`.Table` instance as an argument. (#415)
* Fix a bug in Python 2 where printing a table could raise ``decimal.InvalidOperation``. (#412)
* Fix :class:`.Rank` so it returns Decimal. (#411)
* Added Taurus Olson to AUTHORS.
* Printing a table will now print the table's structure.
* :meth:`.Table.print_structure` implemented. (#393)
* Added Geoffrey Hing to AUTHORS.
* :meth:`.Table.print_html` implemented. (#408)
* Instances of :class:`.Date` and :class:`.DateTime` can now be pickled. (#362)
* :class:`.AgateTestCase` is available as ``agate.testcase.AgateTestCase`` for extensions to use. (#384)
* :meth:`.Table.exclude` implemented. Opposite of :meth:`.Table.select`. (#388)
* :meth:`.Table.merge` now accepts a ``row_names`` argument. (#403)
* :class:`.Formula` now automatically casts computed values to specified data type unless ``cast`` is set to ``False``. (#398)
* Added Neil Bedi to AUTHORS.
* :meth:`.Table.rename` is implemented. (#389)
* :meth:`.TableSet.to_json` is implemented. (#374)
* :meth:`.Table.to_csv` and :meth:`.Table.to_json` will now create the target directory if it does not exist. (#392)
* :class:`.Boolean` will now correctly cast numerical ``0`` and ``1``. (#386)
* :meth:`.Table.merge` now consistently maps column names to rows. (#402)

1.1.0 - November 4, 2015
------------------------

This version of agate introduces three major changes.

1. :class:`.Table`, :meth:`.Table.from_csv` and :meth:`.TableSet.from_csv` now all take ``column_names`` and ``column_types`` as separate arguments instead of as a sequence of tuples. This was done to enable more flexible type inference and to streamline the API.
2. The interfaces for :meth:`.TableSet.aggregate` and :meth:`.Table.compute` have been changed. In both cases the new column name now comes first. Aggregations have also been modified so that the input column name is an argument to the aggregation class, rather than a third element in the tuple.
3. This version drops support for Python 2.6. Testing and bug-fixing for this version was taking substantial time with no evidence that anyone was actually using it. Also, multiple dependencies claim to not support 2.6, even though agate's tests were passing.

* DataType's now have :meth:`.DataType.csvify` and :meth:`.DataType.jsonify` methods for serializing native values.
* Added a dependency on `isodate <https://github.com/gweis/isodate>`_ for handling ISO8601 formatted dates. (#233)
* :class:`.Aggregation` results are no longer cached. (#378)
* Removed `Column.aggregate` method. Use :meth:`.Table.aggregate` instead. (#378)
* Added :meth:`.Table.aggregate` for aggregating single column results. (#378)
* :class:`.Aggregation` subclasses now take column names as their first argument. (#378)
* :meth:`.TableSet.aggregate` and :meth:`.Table.compute` now take the new column name as the first argument. (#378)
* Remove support for Python 2.6.
* :meth:`.Table.to_json` is implemented. (#345)
* :meth:`.Table.from_json` is implemented. (#344, #347)
* :class:`.Date` and :class:`.DateTime` type testing now takes specified format into account. (#361)
* :class:`.Number` data type now takes a ``float_precision`` argument.
* :class:`.Number` data types now work with native float values. (#370)
* :class:`.TypeTester` can now validate Python native types (not just strings). (#367)
* :class:`.TypeTester` can now be used with the :class:`.Table` constructor, not just :meth:`.Table.from_csv`. (#350)
* :class:`.Table`, :meth:`.Table.from_csv` and :meth:`.TableSet.from_csv` now take ``column_names`` and ``column_types`` as separate parameters. (#350)
* :const:`.DEFAULT_NULL_VALUES` (the list of strings that mean null) is now importable from ``agate``.
* :meth:`.Table.from_csv` and :meth:`.Table.to_csv` are now unicode-safe without separately importing csvkit.
* ``agate`` can now be used as a drop-in replacement for Python's ``csv`` module.
* Migrated `csvkit <http://csvkit.readthedocs.org>`_'s unicode CSV reading/writing support into agate. (#354)
